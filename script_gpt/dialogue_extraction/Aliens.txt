        His gloved hand wipes at on opaque layer of dust on the
        canopy.
        ANGLE INSIDE CAPSULE  as light stabs in where the dust is
        wiped away, illuminating a WOMAN, her face in peaceful
        repose.
        WARRANT OFFICER RIPLEY, sole survivor of the Nostromo.
        Nestled next to her is JONES, the ship's wayward cat.

                    Lights are green.  She's alive. 
                    Well, there goes out salvage, guys.
                                                        DISSOLVE TO:
                                   MED-TECH
                    Why don't I open the viewport?
                    Watch your eyes.
        Harsh light floods in as a motorized shield slides into
        the ceiling, REVEALING a breathtaking vista.  Beyond the
        sprawling complex of modular habitats, collectively
        called GATEWAY STATION, is the curve of EARTH as seen
        from high orbit.  Blue and serene.
                                   MED-TECH
                    And how are we today?
                                   RIPLEY
                           (weakly)
                    Terrible.
                                   MED-TECH
                    Just terrible?  That's better
                    than yesterday at least.
                                   RIPLEY
                    How long have I been on
                    Gateway station?
                                   MED-TECH
                    Just a couple of days.  Do you
                    feel up to a visitor?
        Ripley shrugs, not caring.  The door opens and a MAN
        enters, although Ripley sees only what he is carrying.
        A familiar large, orange TOMCAT.
                                   RIPLEY
                    Jones!
        She grabs the cat like a life preserver.
                                   RIPLEY
                           (cooing baby-cat talk)
                    Come here Jonesy you ugly old
                    moose...you ugly thing.
        Jones patiently endures Ripley's embarrassing display,
        seeming none the worse for wear.  The visitor sits
        beside the bed and Ripley finally notices him.  He is
        thirtyish and handsome, in a suit that looks executive
        or legal, the tie loosened with studied casualness.  A
        smile referred to as "winning."
                                   MAN
                    Nice room.  I'm Burke.  Carter Burke.
                    I work for the company, but other
                    than that I'm an okay guy.  Glad to
                    see you're feeling better.  I'm told
                    the weakness and disorientation
                    should pass soon.  Side effects of
                    the unusually long hypersleep, or
                    something like that.
                                   RIPLEY
                    How long was I out there?  They
                    won't tell me anything.
                                   BURKE
                           (soothing)
                    Well, maybe you shouldn't worry
                    about that just yet.
        Ripley grabs his arm, surprising him.
                                   RIPLEY
                    How long?
        Burke gazes at her, thoughtful.
                                   BURKE
                    All right.  My instinct says
                    you're strong enough to handle
                    this...Fifty-seven years.
        Ripley is stunned.  She seems to deflate, her expression
        passing through amazement and shock to realization of
        all she has lost.  Friends.  Family.  Her world.
                                   RIPLEY
                    Fifty-seven...oh, Christ...
                                   BURKE
                    You'd drifted right through the
                    core systems.  It's blind luck that
                    deep-salvage team caught you when
                    they...are you all right?
        Ripley coughs suddenly as if choking and her expression
        becomes one of dawning horror.  Burke hands her a glass
        of water from the nightstand.  She slaps it away.  It
        shatters with a SMASH.  Jones dives, yowling.  Ripley
        grabs her chest, struggling as if she is strangling.
        The Med-Tech hits a console button.
                                   MED-TECH
                           (shouting)
                    Code Blue!  415.  Code Blue!
                                   RIPLEY
                    No...noooo!
        They try to restrain her as she thrashes, knocking over
        equipment.  Her EKG races like mad.  Jones, under a
        cabinet, hisses wide-eyed.
                                   DOCTOR
                    Hold her...Get me an airway, stat!
                    And fifteen cc's of...Jesus!
        AN EXPLOSION OF BLOOD beneath the sheet covering her
        chest!  Ripley stares at the SHAPE RISING UNDER THE
        SHEET.  Tearing itself out of her.
        HER P.O.V. as the sheet rises.  A GLIMPSE OF the
        CHITTERING HORROR...IT SCREECHES.
        TIGHT ON RIPLEY  screaming, snapping up INTO FRAME.
        Alone in the darkened hospital room.  She gasps for
        breath, clutching pathetically at her chest.  There is
        no demented horror rigging itself out of her.  Her eyes
        snap about wildly, slowly focusing on the reality of
        her safety.  Shuddering, bathed in sweat, she kneads her
        breastbone with the heel of her hand and sobs.
        A VIDEO MONITOR beside the bed snaps on.  A MED-TECH's
        face.
                                   MED-TECH
                    Bad dreams again?  Do you want
                    something to help you sleep?
                                   RIPLEY
                           (faint)
                    No.. I've slept enough.
        The Med-Tech shrugs and switches off.  Touching a button
        on the nightstand she opens the viewport, REVEALING
        Gateway and the turquoise Earth.  She hugs Jones to her
        and rocks with him like a child, still shattered by the
        nightmare.  Shivering.  Sleep is far off.
                                   RIPLEY
                    We made it, Jones.  We made it.
        But at what price?
                                                        CUT TO:
                                   RIPLEY
                           (voice over)
                    Dumbshit.
        WIDER ANGLE  as Jones steps back confused from the
        HIGH-RESOLUTION ENVIRONMENTAL WALL SCREEN, a sort of
        cinerama video-loop.  Ripley sits on a bench in what we
        now SEE is an ATRIUM off the medical center, still
        somewhere in the bowels of Gateway Station.  Benches.
        Some unenthusiastic potted trees.  The sterile corridors
        VISIBLE beyond glass doors b.g.
        Burke ENTERS in his usual mode, casual haste.
                                   BURKE
                    Sorry...I've been running behind
                    all morning.
        Ripley seems healthier now, but still a bit brittle.
                                   RIPLEY
                    Have they located my daughter
                    yet?
                                   BURKE
                    Well, I was going to wait
                    until after the inquest...
        He opens his briefcase, removing a sheet of printer
        hard copy, including a telestat photo.
                                   RIPLEY
                    Is she...?
                                   BURKE
                           (scanning)
                    Amanda Ripley-McClaren.  Married
                    name, I guess.  Age:  sixty-six
                    ...at time of death.  Two years
                    ago.
                           (looks at her)
                    I'm sorry.
        Ripley studies the PHOTOGRAPH, stunned.
        The face of a woman in her mid-sixties.  It could be
        anybody.  She tries to reconcile the face with the
        little girl she once knew.
                                   RIPLEY
                    Amy.
                                   BURKE
                           (reading)
                    Cancer.  Hmmmm.  They still haven't
                    licked that one.  Cremated.  Interred
                    Parkside Repository, Little Chute,
                    Wisconsin.  No children.
        Ripley gazes off, into the pseudo-landscape, into the
        past.
                                   RIPLEY
                    I promised her I'd be home for
                    her birthday.  Her eleventh
                    birthday.  I sure missed that
                    one.
                           (pause)
                    Well...she has already learned
                    to take my promises with a grain
                    of salt.  When it came to flight
                    schedules, anyway.
        Burke nods, a simpatico presence.
                                   RIPLEY
                    You always think you can make it
                    up to somebody...later, you know.
                    But now I never can.  I never
                    can.
        Let's get one thing straight...Ripley can be one tough
        lady.  But the terror, the loss, the emptiness are, in
        this moment, overwhelming.  She cries silently.
        Burke puts a reassuring hand on her arm.
                                   BURKE
                           (gently)
                   The hearing convenes at 0930.  You
                   don't want to be late.
                                   RIPLEY
                    You read my deposition...it's
                    complete and accurate.
                                   BURKE
                    Look, I believe you, but there are
                    going to be some heavyweights in
                    there.  You got Feds, you got
                    interstellar commerce commission,
                    you got colonial administration,
                    insurance company guys...
                                   RIPLEY
                    I get the picture.
                                   BURKE
                    Just tell them what happened.  The
                    important thing is to stay cool
                    and unemotional.
                                   RIPLEY
                    Do you people have earwax, of
                    what?  We have been here three
                    hours.  How many different ways
                    do you want me to tell the same
                    story?
        She faces the EIGHT MEMBERS of the board of inquiry at a
        long conference table.  Gray suits and grim faces.  They
        aren't buying.  Behind Ripley on a large VIDEO SCREEN,
        PARKER grins like a goon from his personnel mugshot.  His
        file prints out next to it.  BRETT's face and dossier
        replace it, and then the others as the SCENE continues...
        KANE, LAMBERT, ASH the android traitor, DALLAS.
        VAN LEUWEN, the ICC representative, steeples his fingers
        and frowns.
                                   VAN LEUWEN
                    Look at it from our perspective.
                    You freely admit to detonating the
                    engines of, and thereby destroying,
                    an M-Class star-freighter.  A
                    rather expensive piece of hardware...
                                   INSURANCE INVESTIGATOR 
                           (dryly)
                    Forty-two million in adjusted dollars.
                    That's minus payload, of course.
                                   VAN LEUWEN
                    The shuttle's flight recorder
                    corroborates some elements of
                    your account.  That the Nostromo
                    set down on LV-426, an unsurveyed
                    planet, at that time.  That
                    repairs were made.  That it resumed
                    its course and was subsequently set
                    for self-destruct.  By you.  For
                    reasons unknown.
                                   RIPLEY
                    Look, I told you...
                                   VAN LEUWEN
                    It did not, however, contain any
                    entries concerning the hostile
                    life form you allegedly picked up.
        Ripley sense the noose tightening.
                                   RIPLEY
                    Then somebody's gotten to it...
                    doctored the recorder.  Who had
                    access to it?
        The ECA (Extrasolar Colonization Administration)
        Representative (ECA REP) just shakes his head.
                                   ECA REP
                    Would you just listen to yourself
                    for one minute.
        Ripley glares at the ECA Rep, a woman on the ungenerous
        side of fifty.  Van Leuwen sighs with exasperation.
                                   VAN LEUWEN
                    The analysis team which went over
                    your shuttle centimeter by
                    centimeter found no physical
                    evidence of the creature you
                    describe...
                                   RIPLEY
                           (losing it) 
                    That's because I blew it out the
                    Goddamn airlock!
                           (pause)
                    Like I said.
                                   INSURANCE MAN
                           (to ECA Rep)
                    Are there any species like this
                    'hostile organism' on LV-426?
                                   ECA REP
                    No.  It's a rock.  No indigenous
                    life larger than a simple virus.
        Ripley grits her teeth in frustration.
                                   RIPLEY
                    I told you, it wasn't indigenous.
                    There was an alien spacecraft there.
                    A derelict ship.  We homed on its
                    beacon...
                                   ECA REP
                    To be perfectly frank, we've surveyed
                    over three hundred worlds and no one's
                    ever reported a creature which, using
                    your words...
                           (read from Ripley's
                           statement)
                    ...'gestates in a living human host'
                    and has 'concentrated molecular acid
                    for blood.'
        Ripley glances at Burke, silent at the far end of the
        table.  His expression is grim.  Her mouth hardens as
        a bit of the old nail-eating Ripley surfaces.
                                   RIPLEY
                    Look, I can see where this is
                    going.  But I'm telling you those
                    things exist.  Back on that planetoid
                    is an alien ship and on that ship
                    are thousands of eggs.  Thousands.
                    Do you understand?  I suggest you
                    find it, using the flight recorder's
                    data.  Find it and deal with it --
                    before one of your survey teams
                    comes back with a little surprise...
                                   VAN LEUWEN
                    Thank you, Officer Ripley.  That
                    will be...
                                   RIPLEY
                           (louder, stepping
                           on him)
                    ...because just one of those
                    things managed to kill my entire
                    crew, within twelve hours of
                    hatching...
        Van Leuwen stands, out of patience.
                                   VAN LEUWEN
                    Thank you, that will be all.
        Ripley stares him down, glowering at the board.
                                   RIPLEY
                    That's not all, Goddamnit!  If
                    those things get back here, that
                    will be all.  Then you can just
                    kiss it good-bye, Jack!  Just kiss
                    it goodbye.
